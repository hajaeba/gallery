            <p>The Bob Newhart Show” concluded 40 years ago last month with neither a whimper nor a bang. In fact, there
                weren’t
                many whimpers or bangs during its six-year run. The show was reliable but never flashy, more well-oiled
                Honda
                Accord than Pontiac Firebird.
                In its own way, it influenced decades of television comedy.</p>
